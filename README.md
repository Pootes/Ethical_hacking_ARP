Requirements
Ryu Framework: The application uses the Ryu SDN framework to manage OpenFlow switches and packets.
Install Ryu with the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install ryu
Open vSwitch: Open vSwitch should be installed and configured to allow OpenFlow communication.
Python 2.7 or Python 3.x: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Setup
Install dependencies (Ryu and any other required libraries):

bash
Copy code
pip install ryu
To run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
ryu-manager vlanswitch.py
Replace vlanswitch.py with the filename of your script.

To use the application in a Mininet environment, you can create a Mininet topology with a remote controller as follows:

bash
Copy code
sudo mn --topo single,3 --controller remote --mac --switch ovs,protocols=OpenFlow13
This will create a network with a single Open vSwitch (OVS) switch and three hosts, and it will connect the Mininet simulation to the remote controller running your VLANSwitch application.
